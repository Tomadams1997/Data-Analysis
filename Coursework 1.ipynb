You are visiting the state, and ask a Police Officer what she thinks of the idea. She says she’s against the change to the law. What is the probability that she votes Democrat?\n",

    "Firstly, the data is plotted to visualise any trends within the data set, as well as to see if all arrays were filled in correctly. From visualising the data, it appears to look like there is a negative correlation between the two times. By fitting a first order polynomial (straight line) to the data set, the equation of the straight line can be calculated."

An equation of $y=-8.58x +366.1$ was calculated, showing a negative gradient.

The standard deviation of 100m and 1500m show how the average deviation/spread of results from the mean. The values of standard deviation are $\\sigma_{100m} = 2.33$ and $\\sigma_{1500m}=21.82$.
